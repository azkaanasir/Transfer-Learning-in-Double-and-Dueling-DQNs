## 📄 Project Summary

In this study, we explored how two deep reinforcement learning architectures — **Double DQN (DDQN)** and **Dueling DQN** — perform in both single-task and transfer learning settings. We trained both models on **CartPole-v1**, then attempted to transfer learning to **LunarLander-v2**.

Key focus areas included:
- Convergence speed
- Reward stability
- Generalization across environments

## 📌 Highlights

- **Dueling DQN** learns faster and generalizes early, but is less stable.
- **DDQN** is more consistent and robust over longer training.
- Transfer learning between CartPole and LunarLander was **not effective**, due to complexity gaps and resource constraints.
